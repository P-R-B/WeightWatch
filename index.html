    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p>Here&#39s what existing users have to say about this product:</p>
    <em>
    <p>"I used to have to buy two seats on a plane. Thanks to my WeightWatch repeatedly calling me a fat whale, I have internalised
       enough shame to actually make a huge effort to slim down in time for my next holiday. Now I can be proud of my body when I
       travel abroad."
    </p>
    <p>"I love the simplicity of the interface. Easy to use."</p>
    <p>"Quite an informative little gadget, this is. I just wish it wouldn&#39t lecture me on the perils of high cholesterol and
       diabetes each time I grab a snack."
    </p>
    <p>"I was suffering from high blood pressure before I bought this tool. After reducing me to tears on a daily basis from its
       tough-love messages, I have shed enough salt from my body over the past four weeks to restore my blood pressure to
       normal levels."
    </p>
    <p>"I don&#39t know how this device does it, but it&#39s extremely persuasive in getting me to exercise. I&#39d even jump
       off a cliff if my WeightWatch told me to."
